### Features
- **Sequence Detection**: Detects a predefined sequence of bits.
- **Configurable Sequence Length**: Easily modify the sequence length and pattern.
- **State Machine Design**: Utilizes a finite state machine (FSM) for detection.
- **Simulation**: Includes testbenches for verifying functionality.

### Project Structure
- `src/`: Contains the Verilog source files.
- `tb/`: Contains the testbench files for simulation.
- `docs/`: Documentation and design specifications.
- `sim/`: Simulation results and waveforms.

### Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sequence-detector.git
    cd sequence-detector
    ```
2. Open the Project: Use your preferred Verilog IDE or text editor.
3. Modify the Sequence: Edit the Verilog files to change the sequence pattern if necessary.
4. Run Simulations: Use your Verilog simulator (such as ModelSim or Icarus Verilog) to run the provided testbenches.

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of digital logic design.
- Verilog HDL knowledge.
- Verilog simulation tools (ModelSim, Icarus Verilog, etc.).

### Usage
1. Edit the Sequence: Open `sequence_detector.v` and modify the `SEQUENCE` parameter to the desired bit pattern.
2. Compile and Simulate: Use the provided testbenches in the `tb/` directory to verify the functionality.
3. View Results: Check the simulation waveforms to ensure the sequence is detected correctly.

### Example
Here's an example of detecting the sequence `1011`:
```verilog
parameter SEQUENCE = 4'b1011;
```

### Contributing
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`.
3. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`.
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`.
5. Open a pull request.
